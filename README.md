# monad.js

For people who wish they didn't have to programme in JavaScript

Inspired by projects such as [FunctionalJava][functionalJava] which incorporates monadic functional types into Java, monad.js
seeks to do the same for JavaScript.  There are many wonderful libraries that exist for adding functions such as map and reduce
to lists etc, but none that I've seen that seek to implement other very useful types such as the Option monad.
